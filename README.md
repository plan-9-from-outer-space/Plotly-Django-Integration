# Integrate Plotly Charts into Django Web App (Django Stock Analysis Dashboard)

The codebase contains code for integrating plotly charts into the Django Web App. I create a small Stock Analysis dashboard web app using Django and Plotly. The dashboard displays various stock tickers which when clicked display a Candlestick Chart of historical stock prices for the selected ticker. For retrieving historical OHLC data, I have used the Yahoo-Finance Python library, and for setting web app layout, I have used Bootstrap front-end framework.

Please feel free to check the video below which explains the codebase in detail and also shows the dashboard.
